\section{Professional Experience}

%---------------------
\cventry{Oct. 2018 -- Present}%
{\DPA}{Postdoctoral Fellow}{}{}%
{\Purdue, West Lafayette, IN, USA\\
  \textsc{Mentor}: Prof. Dimitrios Giannios%
%  \newline%
  \begin{itemize}
%    \item Participation and interaction with the members of Prof. Dimitrios Giannios Group.
%    \item Tutoring graduate students with their research projects.
    \item Creator and developer of the code \texttt{Paramo}: a numerical code which solves the Fokker-Planck and radiative transfer equations.
    \item External Compton spectrum and evolution in the context of $\gamma$-ray burst afterglows \cite{Zhang:2020ch}
    \item Connection between the baryon loading and the so-called \emph{blazar sequence} (publication in prep.).
    \item Research grant obtained from the \textit{NASA Fermi Cycle-12 Guest Investigator Program}.
    \item Turbulence as acceleration process in blazars (work in progress)
    \item Accretion around isolated black holes (work in progress)
  \end{itemize}

{\IFMes}{Postdoctoral Fellow}{}{}%
{\UMSNHes, Morelia, Mexico\\
  \textsc{Mentor}: Prof. Francisco S. Guzmán%
%  \newline%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Training graduate students on numerical tools, e.g., HDF5. \url{https://github.com/altjerue/howto_HDF5}
    \item Mentoring graduate students.
    \item Treatment of large number of output images from the numerical code \texttt{GRTRANS} for Machine Learning analysis.

\cventry{Oct. 2011 -- Jul. 2017}%
{\DAAval}{Graduate research assistant}{}{}%
{\UVval, Burjassot, Spain\\
  \textsc{Supervisors}: Prof. Miguel A. Aloy \& Dr. Petar Mimica%
%  \newline%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Applied the \emph{internal-shocks} model in the context of blazar flares to identify the signature of the magnetization in their SEDs. Our results were contrasted with data from the \emph{Fermi} LAT Second AGN Catalog database \cite{RuedaBecerril:2014mi}.
    \item Developed numerical technique to calculate (cyclo-)synchrotron emission from non-, trans-, and ultra-relativistic charged particles. Calculations applied to the \emph{internal-shocks} model of blazar \cite{RuedaBecerril:2017mi}.
