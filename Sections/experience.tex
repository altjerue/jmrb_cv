\begin{itemize}
  \item Studied in depth AGNs and blazars, the blazars models, the radiation transfer equation, the kinetic equation.
  \item Automatized the launching of simulations, treatment of data and generation of plots for an extensive parameter space study of the internal shocks code developed by Petar Mimica and Miguel A. Aloy in order to find traces left in the spectra due to the magnetization of the shocked shells of plasma.
  \item Extracted and interpreted data from the simulations of the main characteristics of blazars SEDs, e.g. Compton dominance, syncrotron and Compton peaks, spectral index.
  \item Extracted, cleaned and processed data from the \emph{Fermi} LAT Second AGN Catalog database for the comparison with our simulations.
  \item I implemented a routine for a more general distribution of particles (thermal and nonthermal) injected at the shock front to be treated in the original code.
  \item I calculated tables with the \mbs\ emission of charged particles of arbitrary velocity, and the emissivity for isotropic distributions of electrons using a code that I developed from scratch.
  \item I implemented the \mbs\ tables to the original code and performed simulations of the internal shocks scenario for blazars.
  \item Interpreted the new SEDs out of the simulations.
  \item Wrote and defended a thesis.
  \item Contributed to the writing of and coauthored two manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

\begin{itemize}
  \item I developed a newtonian and relativistic smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) codes.
  \item I solved the TOV field equations numerically using my RK4 solver.
  \item I wrote a routine with the simple predictor-corrector method: Euler method with the trapezoidal rule.
  \item I simulated a TOV star using the numerical solution of the TOV field equations as initial conditions of the SPH code and evolved the system using the predictor-corrector routine.
  \item Wrote and presented a master thesis with the results obtained.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item Wrote and characterized a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) solver for analytic and numeric input functions for each stage.
  \item I solved the null geodesic equation for two spherically symmetric and static space-times using the RK4 solver: black holes (analytic Christoffel symbols) and boson stars (numeric Christoffel symbols).
  \item I simulated and interpreted light trajectories due to curved space-times and characterized such trajectories for gravitational lenses.
  \item Wrote and presented a thesis with the results obtained.
  \item Contributed to the writing of and coauthored a manuscript for publication in a peer reviewed journal.
