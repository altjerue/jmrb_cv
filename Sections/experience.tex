\begin{itemize}
  \item Automatized the launching of simulations, treatment of data and generation of plots for an extensive parameter space study of the internal shocks code developed by Petar Mimica and Miguel A. Aloy in order to find traces left in the spectra due to the magnetization of the shocked shells of plasma.
  \item Extracted and interpreted from the simulations of the main characteristics of blazars SEDs, e.g. Compton dominance, syncrotron and Compton peaks, spectral index using \texttt{Python} and \texttt{Shell}.
  \item Extracted, cleaned and processed data from the \emph{Fermi} LAT Second AGN Catalog database for the comparison with our simulations.
  \item We confronted a challenge when we intended to include further microphysical phenomena in the simulations. To overcome this
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented a routine for a more general distribution of particles (thermal-nonthermal) to be treated in the original code.
    \item Calculated tables with the \mbs\ emission of charged particles of arbitrary velocity and the emissivity for isotropic distributions of electrons using a code that I developed from scratch.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Contributed to the writing of and coauthored two manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
  \item Developed high expertise with \texttt{Python}, \texttt{R}, \texttt{RStudio}, \texttt{Fortran 95}, \texttt{Shell}, \texttt{git}, \texttt{GitHub}, \texttt{Bitbucket}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A problem posed for master thesis was the simulation of a TOV star using smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical method. For this I developed a newtonian and relativistic SPH codes in \texttt{Fortran 95}.
  \item The evolution of the system was carried out using Predictor-Corrector routine which I also wrote in \texttt{Fortran 95}.
  \item For the initial conditions I used the numerical solution of the TOV field equations, using a fourth order Runge-Kutta solver also written in \texttt{Fortran 95}.
  \item For the analysis and plotting I used and mastered \texttt{gnuplot}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Predict the trajectory of light around black holes and similar objects such as Boson stars was the problem posed for the bachelor degree thesis. To solve such problem I wrote the geodesic equation for a spherically symmetric and static space-time and solved them using a RK4 routine, written in \texttt{Fortran 95}. I characterized such routine studying its convergence and stability for both an analytic and numeric metrics.
  \item I interpreted light trajectories due to curved space-times and characterized such trajectories for gravitational lenses.
  \item Contributing to the writing of and coauthored a manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
