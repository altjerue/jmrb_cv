\section{Profile}
\cvitem{}{Doctor in Astrophysics with high expertise in programming, data
  analysis and problem solving. I am creative, innovative, analyst and hard
  worker.}
%
\cvitem{}{During my PhD studies at the \UVval I developed high programming skills in several languages such as Python, R, Fortran, C/C++, Shell and version control systems like Git. I worked on developing sophisticated numerical tools which were implemented to simulate blazar flares (prompt high energy radiation from relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei) in the \emph{internal shocks} model.}
%
\cvitem{}{I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the \DPA\ at \Purdue, I am developing numerical tools to performe simulations of high energy processes in relativistic jet scenarios such as blazars and $\gamma$-ray bursts, in collaboration with my mentor Prof. Dimitrios Giannios, and the members of his research group.}
%
% \cvitem{}{I am coauthor of three articles in peer reviewed scientific journals and author of a doctoral thesis, qualified as innovative, in which several numerical and programming issues were overcome, reason why it received the distinction of excellent. In addition, I have good English skills which makes me capable of discussing and interact fluently in both Spanish and English.}
%
% \cvitem{}{I want to apply my mathematical knowledge, programming skills and data analysis experience to machine learning, data mining, decision making and modelling.}
