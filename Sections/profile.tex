\section{Profile}
\cvitem{}{Doctor in Astrophysics with high expertise in programming, data
  analysis and problem solving. I am creative, innovative, analyst and hard
  worker.}
%
\cvitem{}{During my PhD studies I developed high programming skills in several languages such as Python, R, Fortran 95, C, Shell and version control tools like Git using platforms such as GitHub and Bitbucket. I worked on developing sophisticated numerical tools which were implemented to simulate blazar flares (prompt high energy radiation from relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei). This has shown my fast learning skill of new programming languages and develop efficient codes to solve the problem posed.}
%
\cvitem{}{In my present position as a postdoctoral researcher at \Purdue{,} I am developing numerical tools to performe simulations of high energy processes in relativistic jet scenarios such as blazars and $\gamma$-ray bursts, in collaboration with Prof. Dimitrios Giannios and the members of his research group.}
%
% \cvitem{}{I am coauthor of three articles in peer reviewed scientific journals and author of a doctoral thesis, qualified as innovative, in which several numerical and programming issues were overcome, reason why it received the distinction of excellent. In addition, I have good English skills which makes me capable of discussing and interact fluently in both Spanish and English.}
%
% \cvitem{}{I want to apply my mathematical knowledge, programming skills and data analysis experience to machine learning, data mining, decision making and modelling.}
