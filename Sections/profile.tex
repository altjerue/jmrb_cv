I have extensive experience debugging, testing, and maintaining sophisticated code in scientific and business arenas. I have strong programming skills in multiple languages like Python, Fortran, C/C++, Shell, Java, SQL, and I am experienced in managing version control systems (e.g., git). Additionally, I have experience in high-performance computing (HPC) and data science and a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. In my free time, I like to catch up with the most recent discoveries about the mysteries of our universe and I am an avid climber.
