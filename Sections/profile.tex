\section{Profile}
\cvitem{}{%
  I am a trained astrophysicist with a strong background in programming, data science, and problem-solving, bringing analytical rigor and innovation to both scientific and industry settings. With expertise in debugging, testing, and maintaining complex code, I have extensive experience working with Python, Fortran, C/C++, Shell, R, and SQL, as well as managing version control systems like Git. My proficiency in high-performance computing (HPC), data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling allows me to tackle challenging problems efficiently. A highly adaptable and effective communicator in both English and Spanish, I thrive in both independent and collaborative environments.
