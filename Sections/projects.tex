{Open Source Code for Simulation of Relativistic Particles Radiation}%
{Tleco}%
{Jan 2024 -- Sep 2024}%
{}%
{%
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Tleco} stands for both \emph{in the fire} and \emph{rise} in the nahuatl language. 
    \item Numerical code that simulates particles in relativistic plasma, and the rise of radiation from accelerating particles.
    \item Consists of both Rust functions and Python functions previously built in the Fortran code \texttt{Paramo}.
\end{itemize}

{Open Source Code for Radiative Transfer Simulations in Relativistic Astrophysics}%
{Paramo}%
{Oct 2018 -- Apr 2022}%
{}%
{%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Independently developed this code for distributed settings to perform HPC simulations of radiative transfer in relativistic astrophysics.
    \item Optimized the code with OpenMP to reduce simulation time from 2 minutes to 5 seconds.
    \item Researched and applied mathematical concepts of machine learning (gradient descent) to adjust the parameters of the code to classify observations from NASA telescopes.
    \item This code has been used for at least 5 scientific publications and also for graduate pedagogical purposes.
    \item Developed data analysis and data visualization tools in Python.
\end{itemize}

{Group of Mexican Scientists narrowing the gap between science and common knowledge}%
{Co-Founder, Mexican Scientists Abroad}%
{Aug 2019 -- Feb 2021}%
{}%
{%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collaborated with a group of multidisciplinary scientists to develop Python scripts for \href{https://mexiciencia.github.io/post/covid19/}{statistically modeling and forecasting the COVID-19 outbreak} in Mexico. 
    \item Wrote \href{https://mexiciencia.github.io/post/modelo-sir/}{blogposts} and \href{https://mexiciencia.github.io/post/anita/}{infographics} for non-technical Spanish-speaking populations to reduce the spread of misinformation.
\end{itemize}
